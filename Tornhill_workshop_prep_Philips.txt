# Code As A Crime Scene: Fix Technical Debt with Behavioural Code Analysis (Philips, Boston 2018)

NOTE: the workshop will mix theory with hands-on practical exercises. If you want to take this opportunity to analyse your own codebase, then you need to follow the preparation instructions below.
You can of course participate in the workshop _without_ doing the preparations. In that case, we'll use prepared analyses of various codebases shared via codescene.io (more instructions follow during the workshop).

## Environment

You need to bring your own laptop for the practical exercises. If you run a virtual machine, make sure you allocate at least 4 Gb RAM.

You need to have the following programs installed:

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc).
* A 64 bits Java JDK, version 8. You can test that you got the correct version by typing "java -version" at your command prompt.
* A Git command line client, at least version 2.15. You can download a Git client here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Ensure that your Git client is available on your PATH. That is, from a command line terminal (DOS, shell, etc) you should be able to type "git --version" and get something like "git version 2.15" back.

NOTE: it's important that you use Java 8 - the tools won't work with older versions.

NOTE2: if you cannot install these tools you can still participate in the workshop by pairing with another participant or by using the pre-generated analysis results from codescene.io (instructions follow at the workshop in that case).

## Preparations

Download CodeScene from the following link: 
https://downloads.codescene.io/enterprise/2.5.0/codescene-enterprise-edition.standalone.jar

This version of CodeScene is packaged as a standalone JAR. That means you start it from a command prompt. So please open a shell (or DOS window), go to the folder where you've saved the file `codescene-enterprise-edition.standalone.jar` and type the following:

   java -jar codescene-enterprise-edition.standalone.jar

This will launch a web server and you should see something like the following output in your terminal:

   adam$ java -jar codescene-enterprise-edition.standalone.jar
   Applying 0001-initial
   Applying 0002-external-applications
   Applying 0003-configure-anonymize-results
   ...

That's it! Now, open your browser and point it to http://localhost:3003/

If everything is correctly installed, you see a page that prompts for a product key. That's great - you're prepared for the workshop!

### Clone Git Repositories for the Case Studies

I recommend that you take this opportunity to analyze your own code, or some open source that you use often. Just make sure you have a local clone of your Git repository on your laptop.

We'll also analyze a number of well-known open source projects to find real problems. Please prepare by cloning the following Git repositories to a folder on your laptop:

* git clone https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc
* git clone git@github.com:nopSolutions/nopCommerce.git
* git clone git@github.com:erlang/otp.git
* Optional: Clone all the repositories in Spinnaker, described and linked here: https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/architecture/
  We use Spinnaker as an example on analyses in a multi-repository, microservice like project.
